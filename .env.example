# Notes:
# 1. For Windows PowerShell temporary session:  $Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-REPLACE" ; mvn -DskipTests spring-boot:run
# 2. To persist:  setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-REPLACE"  (then restart terminal)
# 3. The backend reads OPENAI_API_KEY from the process environment, not from this file unless you export it before starting.
